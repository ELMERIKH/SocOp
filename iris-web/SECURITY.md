## Reporting security vulnerabilities 
*This applies to any repository present in the DFIR-IRIS organisation.*  

In case a security vulnerability is found, we kindly ask you to report it by [email](mailto:report@dfir-iris.org) instead of creating an issue.  
This will let us the time to patch and create a new release.   
We are fully transparent and any raised security issue will be reported in the security advisory section once patched.
